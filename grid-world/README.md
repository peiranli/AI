Assignment 1: Grid World
=========

Your task is to implement the following search strategies in `methods.py`:

- Breadth-First Search
- Uniform Cost Search
- A\* Search

Look at the code. It should be obvious where the functions are. The movie file shows what these functions should achieve.  

Due date
-----
Jan-24 11pm Pacific Time.

Grading
-----
- Regular Commits (2 points)

You should have a commit with nontrivial improvement every week.

- Documentation (2 points)

In the file, you'll see placeholders for comments `#...`. Fill in those comments to explain (briefly) the functionality of the several lines of code after them. There are not standard answers, of course, but write things that would make it easy for other people, which includes the version of yourself one week from now, to understand the code.

- Functionality (8 points)

The output should look exactly like what the movie file shows. For UCS and AStar, always output (in the terminal) the final cost of the path you find in the end.

- Extra credits (2 points; you can only get it if you have collected the other points)

Currently the environment is randomly generated every time you clear the grid. Design two interesting environments and the corresponding keys to pick them.
Press 'r' to generate a random maze with random puddles. Press 'm' to generate a pure maze with just random grass.

Note
------
- You need to install the pygame library to make things work. I'm sure you can figure out how.
- Note that you can click mouse to put down more puddles when search is not running.
- The code works for both Python3 and Python2.
- You should not `import` any other libraries than the ones that are already used.
- At the deadline, Github will automatically save the last commit as your submission. Make sure to commit your full solutions before that.
